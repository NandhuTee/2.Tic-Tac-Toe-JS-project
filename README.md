# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in HTML,CSS,Javascript

## Description

Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to get three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal.

This project provides a console-based implementation of the game using Python. It allows two players to take turns entering their moves and determines the winner or declares a draw when appropriate.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the directory where the game is located.
3. Run the Python file `tic_tac_toe.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Players take turns entering their moves by selecting a position on the 3x3 grid.
